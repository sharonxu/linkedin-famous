This podcast dives into the transformation of RAG architectures from disjoint components to jointly and continually optimized systems.Our conversation dives deep into the vision behind RAG 2.0 -- and why current RAG implementations resemble a \"Frankenstein\" design of naively gluing together retrieval models, generators, and external tools without proper integration. While functional, this method struggles with integrating domain-specific knowledge, requiring constant prompt engineering maintenance in production environments, as well as more technical concepts such as parametric knowledge conflicts.Amanpreet discusses the fundamental perspectives of RAG 2.0, how it has evolved with tool use, and other fundamental concepts such as the details behind Reinforcement Learning for optimizing LLMs! Amanpreet also explained many of the innovations from Contextual AI such as KTO, APO, LMUnit evals, and the launch of the Contextual AI Platform! I really hope you enjoy the podcast!",

    "post": "Harvard says AI tutors are better than Harvard professors. A recent study showed Harvard undergrads improved their physics scores 2x as much with an AI tutor than in an active-learning lecture. What are the implications?Students engaging with AI tutors learn more and in far less time. This holds true when compared to the previous gold standard in classroom instruction: active learning (peer instruction, small-group activities, flipped classrooms).The 1-on-1 tutor finding is not new. Bloom's Two Sigma Problem found that the average student tutored 1-to-1 using mastery learning performed two standard deviations higher than students educated in a classroom environment.This is why so many people are excited about AI in education ‚Äì¬†it can provide everyone with a 1-to-1 tutor that adapts instruction to exactly what each student needs.My Take: I'm cautiously optimistic. It's so hard to implement technology in the classroom that meaningfully improves learning outcomes at scale. AI tutors may supercharge learning for the self-motivated student. However, most students will not engage with AI tutors correctly and meaningfully without oversight and being held accountable. There will always be a role for human teachers/tutors.I will say that if we figure out AI tutors, the whole learning system will be upended. Classtime will need to further focus on implementing what students learn in more challenging situations to build critical thinking and problem solving skills. At least kids won't fall asleep during lectures in the AI tutor future.What's your take on Harvard's AI tutor finding or the future of AI tutors in general?--Study URL: https:// www. researchsquare. com/article/rs-4243877/v1",

    "post": "Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming education, but US public schools face significant challenges in preparing students for the AI-powered future. To equip learners with the technical skills, digital literacy, critical thinking abilities, and interpersonal competencies needed to thrive in an AI-driven world, schools must thoughtfully integrate AI tools and concepts into curricula, pedagogy, and operations. However, obstacles abound, from the high costs of implementation to the gaping digital divide to the lack of teacher training and ethical guardrails.This article provides a comprehensive roadmap for schools navigating the AI revolution. It explores cost-effective strategies like pursuing grants and partnerships, prioritizing open-source tools, and phasing rollouts. It emphasizes the importance of building capacity through robust teacher professional development and student AI literacy initiatives. Most importantly, it argues for putting ethics and equity at the center of AI integration efforts to ensure all learners benefit. While the path forward is challenging, the potential of AI to create more engaging, effective, and equitable learning experiences is immense for schools willing to dream big and act boldly.hashtag#AIinEducation hashtag#FutureofLearning hashtag#DigitalEquity hashtag#21stCenturySkills hashtag#EthicalAI",

While 65% of today's primary school students will work in jobs that don't yet exist, our educational institutions remain tethered to outdated practices that prioritize standardized testing over the critical thinking and technological literacy essential for success in an AI-driven future.This systemic failure demands immediate action. Our analysis reveals that only 51% of schools in low-income areas have the high-speed internet necessary for AI tools, creating a devastating digital divide. To maintain America's global competitiveness and ensure equitable opportunities, we must revolutionize K-12 education through comprehensive AI literacy programs, enhanced teacher training, and modernized infrastructure that reaches all communities.hashtag#FutureOfEducation hashtag#ArtificialIntelligence hashtag#K12Education hashtag#EdTech hashtag#DigitalEquity",

Students training on virtual welding simulators need low-latency networks. Healthcare students practicing procedures in AR environments depend on stable connections. Advanced manufacturing programs rely on secure data transmission between equipment.Every learning program deserves a strong technological foundation. Educational institutions should consider building their technology strategy on a foundation of reliable infrastructure. This enables them to adapt quickly as new training tools emerge. To ensure that hands-on, immersive learning prepares students for future careers, educators must build sophisticated networks that can handle complex data streams.The future workforce needs both technical skills and practical experience.
